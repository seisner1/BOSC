Purpose: To temporarily track SST versions while trying to find optimal SST correction scheme


v1 - Set cutoff for low SST gradient to norm_grad<=5e-6 yields alpha=0 (ignore contributions where SST gradient is too low)

v2 - changed cutoff for low SST gradient to norm_grad<=1e-6 yields alpha=0

v3 - changed cutoff for low SST gradient to norm_grad<=1e-8

v5 - Included a cutoff for low background yielding alpha=0

v6 - No version

v7 - All SST have advective component (bkg comp parallel to gradient) removed

v8 - Combined no advective SST with advective SST by taking gauss weighted combination where no advective SST is highest within Ro radius of Eq

v9 - Changed to include the SST_param weighting (sst_param = 1e-8/norm_grad with norm_grad averaged over 5 days and 1 deg box) for the no advection SST
