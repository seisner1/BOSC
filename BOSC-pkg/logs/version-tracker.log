Versions					Summary/Changes


T2.0.1						First version with full Geostrophy, Ekman/Stokes, mean correction, and SST correction for 2018-2020
						Geos - Basic Geostrophy from SLA with equatorial smoothing (Sudre et al 2014)
						Ekman/Stokes - Constant Eddy diffusivity (8e-2), Ekman spiral with amp based on Ekman depth (determined by diffusivity). Emperical spiral (Rio et al 2014)
						SST Correction - Corrects all of U and V using SST, weighted combination, weighting only corrects in the lat band -5:5, (Rio et al 2018) 
						coverage - 0.25 deg, daily, 2018-2020


T2.0.2						Updates to SST correction algorithm
						SST correction - Corrects only the perpendicular component of U and V, weighted comb, weighting is global but most correction in lat band -5:5




T2.0.3						Updates to weighting algorithm
						SST Correction - weighting is altered to improve weighting in mid-latitudes



T2.0.4						Further updates to weighting algorithm
						SST Correction - weighting removes dependence on SST rate of change to try to improve mid-latitude performance


T2.0.5						Weighting algorithm updates
						SST Correction - weighting is updated to |grad_SST|/|f| and weighting params are set to gamma = 12, eps = 100, SST alg is the same as (Rio et al 2018)
								but with weighting
						coverage - 0.25 deg, daily, 2018-2020


T2.0.6						Update to grid resolution/Replacement of SST dataset
						SST Correction - SST data is replaced with OSPO Geopolar Blended Nighttime
						Coverage - 0.16 deg, daily, 2017-2020


T2.0.7						Update to time span and time means
						Means - Means are updated to be computed from 2017-2021. Geos, Ekman/Stokes components are corrected by replacing the longer span means with 
							Laurindo et al (2018) means
						Time Spac - Covers 2017 to 2021
						coverage - 0.16 deg, daily, 2017-2021




T2.0.8						Update to Semi-Geos Calc
						Geos-computing Geos directly on 1/6 deg grid, added Jan-Feb of 2017
